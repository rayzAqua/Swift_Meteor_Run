# Swift_Meteor_Run

**In a vast, star-filled galaxy, you control a small spaceship on a thrilling space adventure.
Your goal is to collect glowing stars to gain energy while avoiding fast-moving meteors. Hitting a meteor will reduce your space station’s energy, bringing you closer to losing the game.

Luckily, you can activate a special speed boost that lets you fly through danger and pass through obstacles without taking damage — but only for a short time!

This game is fast and exciting. It will test your focus and quick reflexes. Collect enough energy before your station runs out of power — and see how far you can go in the endless beauty of space!
